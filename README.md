# ai searching
This programming reads nodes from file in form of node1 node2 
edgeweight(distance) and also reads heuristics from a different 
file in form of node heuristic(euclidian distance(km) to goal 
node of '105012740'). It then performs a breadth first search, 
uniform cost search, and a* search to find a path from input 
node to node '105012740'
